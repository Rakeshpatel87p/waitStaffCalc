Steps:

2) Migrate controller properly so that the numbers run.
	-rootScope method (have tried pegging variables to root that are used in my-earnings page but not displaying proper numbers when page loads to my-earnings page)
		-But views share controllers so wouldn't they share variable values?
3) Make sure all buttons are functioning.
